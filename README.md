# Web Scraping

An R script that scrapes [data from an HTML table](https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/members-official-twitter-handles) using the rvest package. This table contains the names of the US congress members, their twitter handles and the party they belong to. This information was used in Graph Neural Networks (GNN) research by Dr. Akcora.

**Note:** The table in the above website is updated from time to time, hence members.R may need to be updated if new changes made to the website produce unexpected results.
